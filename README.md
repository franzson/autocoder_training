# autocoder_training

Open [this](https://github.com/franzson/autocoder_training/blob/main/autoencoder_simple.ipynb) notebook in Google Colab. You can do this by using the Chrome plugin [Open in Colab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo?hl=en),
or by downloading it from github and uploading it into colab.

Make sure to set the runtime type to GPU (Runtime->Change Runtime Type) or training will take
an enternity.

Once training finishes, a download of the model should be automatically triggered. If not, then manually download the zip file that the script created, containing the files needed for inference in Max/MSP.

To test the model, please refer to the [autocoder_external](https://github.com/franzson/autocoder_external) documentation.
